# NobleScholar :scientist:
The interface is designed to streamline the verification and discovery of references to presently retracted academic papers. Relying on academic findings derived from retracted papers, which have been identified as lacking integrity or falsifying underlying results, can have detrimental consequences. This can lead to a cascading effect wherein subsequent research findings may also be compromised, as they are at least partially built upon a foundation of falsified data.

## How it works 
### CLI Interace
Users may use CLI interface to check their [DOIs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Object_Identifier) if they have been retracted and are to find in the cross ref database. 

### Web Application
Users may as well use the web application interface to drag and drop their files and receive cross check if any of the used DOIs are available in retracted database.
